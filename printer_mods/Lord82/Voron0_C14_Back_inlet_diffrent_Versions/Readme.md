# Here are some variations of cC14-Mount also with a Deck_Panel_Rear and a Bck-Cover for it


# Use with regular Voron-0 Backpanel:
if you use the regular Backpanel, then use the c14 Mount with _flat and the Deck_Panel_Rear.stl
--> Then you heave to cut the right hole into your Backpanel for access to the inlet.

# Use with my Back-Cover:
if you use the Back-Cover, then use that c14 Mount without _flat, the Deck_Panel_Rear_vX_Back-Cover.stl and Back_Cover_vX.stl you wont.



==> All of them fit together, so you can combine what you want.
